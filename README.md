# Autonomous_Car
This project consists of a Raspberry Pi controlled RC car that utilizes machine learning to follow lines. A Raspberry Pi 3B was used to control a 1/10th scale Exceed RC truck. The program, written in python, allows for manual and autonomous modes. The autonomous potions features a Tensorflow model to compute motor controls.
## Setup
### Hardware
 * 1/10th Scale Exceed RC Truck (must have seperate radio receiver and motor controller)
 * Raspberry Pi 3B
 * Arduino Uno
 * Adafruit PCA9685 Motor Control Board
 * Adafruit MMA8451 Accelerometer
 * Raspberry Pi Camera
 * Sonar Sensor
